                <h3>Research Report/Plan</h3>
                <p>Participants are sensitised with 6-10 highly targeted exercises, and the generative session utilises 2-3 well-executed techniques that demonstrate and build upon approaches taught in class. Any new approaches are academically justified. Additional research methods are used to supplement findings. Great justification for the selected participants. Thank you for providing additional detail on each of the participants' interests to show relevance.</p>
                <p>Research plan is thorough, well-written and demonstrates exceptional academic justification. Planning of context-mapping demonstrates an exceptionally clear well-founded understand of generative methods. Correct referencing.</p>

                <h3>Research Visualisation </h3>
                <p>Research visualisation is of professional quality, and promotes great empathy with and understanding of the target group. It works as a stand-alone communication tool, making excellent use of information hierarchy to provide clear themes, additional explanation, and evidence in a well-balanced manner.</p>

                <h3>Second Research Report / Design Brief</h3>
                <p>Clear, inspiring and well-supported brief that is grounded in the research from Assessment 2, and provides an interesting direction for further development. Demonstrates a strong understanding of visioning methods. I like that you have included pros and cons of the vision - shows that the vision is thorough. Including the point about making technology unobtrusive is also a nice touch as this responds well to the initial concerns from the museum panel. </p>
                <p>Brief is a logical continuation from research insights, and includes justification from both primary and secondary sources. Your design brief is well-supported by both findings from your research and secondary research. This is inspirational and provides a good direction for the design. Professional quality of written communication enables reader to focus on the key concepts and significant findings, and conveys a powerful and visionary message. Great job, you have a well-designed layout coupled with great writing and evidencing. I found it easy to go through your design brief.</p>

                <h3>User Journey Map</h3>
                <p>Excellent visual communication and documentation of the final design, which covers a tremendous scope of the user experience but retains clear coherency and internal logic. Touchpoint is an effective and well-resolved illustration clearly drawn from the overall experience. You have designed a lovely user journey map that is well supported by research. The illustrations are both engaging and effective in visually conveying the final user experience.</p>
